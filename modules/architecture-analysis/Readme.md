### MAU and DAU
MAU and DAU are metrics commonly used in the digital industry to measure the popularity and engagement of a digital product or service, such as a website or mobile app.

* MAU stands for "Monthly Active Users" and is a measure of how many unique users engage with a product or service within a given month. It is calculated by counting the number of unique users who have accessed the product or service during the month.
* DAU stands for "Daily Active Users" and is a measure of how many unique users engage with a product or service within a given day. It is calculated by counting the number of unique users who have accessed the product or service during the day.

Both MAU and DAU are important metrics for businesses and digital product/service providers, as they provide insights into the level of engagement and retention of users. They can be used to track the growth or decline of a product or service, identify trends and patterns in user behavior, and inform strategic decisions related to marketing, product development, and user acquisition.


> Disk I/O (Input/Output) is the process of reading or writing data from or to a disk. This process involves accessing the storage medium (i.e. hard disk, solid-state drive, USB drive, etc.) to read data that has been stored on it or to write new data onto it. Disk I/O is an important concept in computer systems and can have a significant impact on the overall performance of a system.

Disk I/O can be categorized into two types: Sequential I/O and Random I/O.

* Sequential I/O: In sequential I/O, data is read or written in a sequential manner. For example, when copying a large file from one location to another, the data is read from the source location and written to the destination location in a sequential manner. Sequential I/O operations are generally faster than random I/O operations, as the disk's read/write head can read or write data in a continuous stream without having to move back and forth across the disk.

* Random I/O: In random I/O, data is read or written in a non-sequential manner. For example, when accessing a database, data is read from different locations on the disk depending on the data being accessed. Random I/O operations are generally slower than sequential I/O operations because the disk's read/write head has to move back and forth across the disk to read or write data from different locations.

> Disk I/O performance can be affected by various factors, including disk speed, file system type, file size, and the number of I/O operations being performed simultaneously. Slower disks will generally result in slower I/O performance, while faster disks will result in faster I/O performance.

Here are some examples of Disk I/O operations:

* Copying files: When copying files from one location to another, data is read from the source disk and written to the destination disk. This involves a lot of disk I/O operations.

* Database access: When accessing a database, data is read from or written to different locations on the disk depending on the data being accessed. This involves random disk I/O operations.

* Video editing: When editing a video, the software reads the video file from the disk, processes it, and writes the processed video back to the disk. This involves a lot of disk I/O operations, both sequential and random.

* Booting up a computer: When a computer boots up, it reads data from the hard disk to load the operating system and other programs. This involves a lot of disk I/O operations, particularly sequential I/O operations.
