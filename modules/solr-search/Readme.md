## Introduction:
Familiarize yourself with the principles of information retrieval, including document indexing, relevance ranking, and query parsing.

### Principles of information retrieval in Solr:
* #### Text analysis:
Text analysis in Solr refers to the process of transforming raw text data into structured data that can be used for search and other operations. This process includes tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and other techniques.

> ##### Tokenization is the process of breaking up text into individual tokens or terms. Solr provides several tokenizers, such as WhitespaceTokenizer, KeywordTokenizer, and StandardTokenizer, that can be used to split text into tokens based on different criteria. For example, the StandardTokenizer uses a sophisticated algorithm to split text into tokens based on word boundaries, punctuation, and other factors.

> ##### Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form, so that variations of the same word can be treated as equivalent. Solr provides several stemmers, such as PorterStemmer and SnowballPorterFilterFactory, that can be used to apply different stemming algorithms to text.

> ##### Stopword removal is the process of removing common words from text, such as "the", "and", "of", and "a", which are not useful for search. Solr provides a StopFilter that can be used to remove stopwords from text.

> ##### In addition to these techniques, Solr provides many other text analysis features, such as synonym expansion, spell checking, and more. Here is an example Java code snippet that shows how to configure a Solr index to perform text analysis:

* #### Indexing: 
Solr indexes the preprocessed text data to enable efficient search and retrieval. Solr supports several indexing algorithms such as term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and Boolean indexing.

* #### Querying: 
Solr provides a powerful query language that enables users to construct complex queries and retrieve relevant documents. The query language supports several query types such as Boolean queries, phrase queries, and fuzzy queries.

* #### Relevance ranking: 
Solr uses relevance ranking algorithms to sort the search results based on their relevance to the query. Solr supports several relevance ranking algorithms such as TF-IDF, BM25, and DFR.

* #### Faceting: 
Solr provides faceting capabilities to enable users to explore the data and retrieve insights. Faceting allows users to drill down into the search results and explore the data along different dimensions.

* #### Highlighting: 
Solr provides highlighting capabilities to enable users to see the search terms in context within the retrieved documents. Highlighting makes it easier for users to understand the relevance of the retrieved documents.

* #### Spatial search: 
Solr supports spatial search capabilities to enable users to search for documents based on their location. Solr supports several spatial search algorithms such as bounding box search, distance search, and polygon search.
